# hrt-move-editor
Usage:
in terminal run
python app.py

Restore - It will add back all h moves
Refresh - Not really needed to press it, it will just reload the mod folders data files
Save - Will save your changes to the mod files

How it works:

First it makes a backup copy of each mod file. Then you can pick and choose which ones you want to keep
